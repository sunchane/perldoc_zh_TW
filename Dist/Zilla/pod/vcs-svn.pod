=head1 Integrating Dist::Zilla with Subversion

Dist::Zilla's Subversion support is limited, and provided by the non-core
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Subversion>.  By adding C<[Subversion::Tag]> to your
configuration, you can tag releases after they're made.

This is a Dist::Zilla add-on that you'll need to install separately from
Dist::Zilla.

Most of Dist::Zilla's contributors use L<Git|http://git-scm.com/> and would
love it if you did, too.
